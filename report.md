###### Evaluation Plan
- measure performance of a sequential sort
  - Increasing input sizes & constant input sizes

- measure performance of MPI sort:
  - Increase the number of processors & keep problem size constant
  - Increase problem size & increase number of processors 

- measure performance of CUDA sort:
  - Increase number of threads with a constant problem size
  - Increase number of threads with increasing problem size
